Background

AtliQ Motors is an imaginary automotive giant specializing in electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrids, with a strong presence in North America (holding 25% market share). The strategic objective of the project is to support AtliQ Motors' leadership by providing a detailed market study of the Indian EV segment where the current market share is less than 2%.

Objectives

Market Entry Analysis: Provide a detailed assessment of the EV market landscape in India.

Trend Analysis: Evaluate fiscal data from FY22 to FY24 for key metrics like EV sales, revenue, and market penetration.

Regional Insights: Highlight key performance indicators such as state-wise EV sales, growth rates, and manufacturer performance.

Strategic Recommendations: Identify primary drivers for EV adoption in India and suggest actionable recommendations for market entry and further investments.

Data Sources & Assumptions

Dataset: The analysis is based on an aggregated dataset representing the EV and hybrid market across various states and manufacturers over fiscal years 2022–2024.

Assumptions:

The project uses hypothetical data for academic and showcase purposes.

Average unit prices were assumed for 2-wheelers (₹85K) and 4-wheelers (₹1,500K).

Market trends (penetration rates, YoY growth, CAGR) are derived from the data provided.

Methodology

Data Collection & Cleaning:

Aggregated state-wise and manufacturer-wise EV sales and revenue data.

Cleaned and structured data in Excel for consistency.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyzed key performance indicators (KPIs) such as market penetration rates, quarterly trends, and revenue growth.

Identified top-performing states and manufacturers within the EV market.
